# Slider Puzzle

## Demo
Demo can be found [here](http://jenrefat.com/demos/sliderPuzzle/ "Slider Puzzle")  


## Concept
This challenge was to create the classic "Slider Puzzle" game which I used to play all the time when growing up.  

## Usage
* A 4x4 numbered grid using a single background image.
* User can interact with puzzle by clicking on a tile to move it or to drag and drop a tile into the empty slot.  
* The game is designed to look as if it was being played on an iPad. 
* Once solved, a congratulatory message displays while removing interactivity at this stage.  If the user reshuffles the board at this point, the game restarts.
* Mobile friendly
